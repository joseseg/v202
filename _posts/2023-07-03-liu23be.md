title: 'N$\text{A}^{\text{2}}$Q: Neural Attention Additive Model for Interpretable Multi-Agent
  Q-Learning'
openreview: oUeo2uG1AZ
abstract: Value decomposition is widely used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
  learning, however, its implicit credit assignment mechanism is not yet fully understood
  due to black-box networks. In this work, we study an interpretable value decomposition
  framework via the family of generalized additive models. We present a novel method,
  named Neural Attention Additive Q-learning (N$\text{A}^\text{2}$Q), providing inherent
  intelligibility of collaboration behavior. N$\text{A}^\text{2}$Q can explicitly
  factorize the optimal joint policy induced by enriching shape functions to model
  all possible coalition of agents into individual policies. Moreover, we construct
  the identity semantics to promote estimating credits together with the global state
  and individual value functions, where local semantic masks help us diagnose whether
  each agent captures the relevant-task information. Extensive experiments show that
  N$\text{A}^\text{2}$Q consistently achieves superior performance compared to different
  state-of-the-art methods on all challenging tasks, while yielding human-like 
  interpretability.
